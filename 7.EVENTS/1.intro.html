        /*****1. EVENTS in Javascript *****/

        // HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
        // when Javascript is used in HTML pages, Javascript can "react" on these events.

        // -->HTML Events
        // An html event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

        // Here are some examples of HTML events:

        // An HTML web page has finished loading
        // An HTML input field was changed
        // An HTML button was clicked
        // often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

        // Javascript lets you execute code when events are detected.

        //HTML  allows event handler attributes, with Javascript code, to be added to HTML elements

        // Section 1 -> 4 Ways of writing Events in Javascript

        // 1:using inline events alert();
        // 2: By calling a function (we already seen and most common way of writing)
        // 3: using inline events (HTML onclick= "" property and element.onclick)
        // 4: using Event listeners (addEventlistener and IE's attachEvent)

        // check the events HTML file



        // section 2 --> What is Event Object?
        // EventObj.html
        // Event object is the parent object of the event object.
        // for Example 
        // MouseEvent, focuseEvent, keyboardEvent etc




        // section 3--> MouseEvent in Javascript
        // The MouseEvent Object
        // events that occur when the mouse interacts with the HTML
        // document belongs to the MouseEvent Object.



        // section 4 --> KeyboardEvent in Javascript
        // events that occur when user presses a key on the keyboard.
        // belongs to the keyboardEvent object.
        // i.onkeypress
        // ii.onkeydown
        // iii.onkeyup




        // section 5 --> InputEvents in Javascript
        // The onchange event occurs when the value of an element has been changed

        // for radiobuttons and checkboxes, the onchange event occurs when the 
        // checked state has been changed.
